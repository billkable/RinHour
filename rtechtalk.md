# R under 1 Hour
## Introduction
### What is it?

### A little History
- S
- Fortran
- Embraces many long standing concepts and processes
	- Functional Programming
	- Literate Programming
	
### What is is good for?
- Predominant in statistics world
- One of leading language eco-systems in Data Science
	- Exploratory analysis
	- Publishing analysis
- Rapidly evolving to support Big Data Analytics applications
- Very common in Healthcare and Science Research

### Coding
#### Functional Language
- Basic code block example
- Data types
- Collections (vector, list, matrix, data frames)
- data tables/data frames
- chaining and compare to pipes and map/reduce

#### Basic I/O support
- Base R limited to local file set on R server (or workstation) - We'll talk later about R scaling evolution.
- fread
- API access to underlying OS

#### Large eco-system of statistics and analytics support
- CRAN
- Basic Statistics 

#### Flexible Plotting support
- Demontrate
- Base plotting system
- ggplot

#### Flexible Reporting support
- Literate Programming
	- Markdown, RMarkdown
	- knitr
- slidify
- Modern benefits
	 - Fits with agile goals
	 	- streamlined documentation
		- Generation is part of development/analysis process

#### GUI support ecosystem (Shiny)
- Demonstrate Performance Analysis Tool

#### Evolution & Commercial Support
- Ability to work with RDBMS, Hive (distributed large query)
- Revolution Analytics (Microsoft)
